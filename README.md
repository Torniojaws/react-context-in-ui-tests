# React Context API in UI tests

This is a test project on how to "configure" React Context API when running UI
unit tests using `testing-library`. Eg. when the context state changes during
the test, the UI test will also "see" the new state.

The main beef of this repo is **Greetings.test.tsx**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
